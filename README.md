The **Exercises** are included in each folder.

The **Projects** are also included in their own folders:

1. [Supervised Learning: finding charity donors, extracted feature importance, using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM) ](https://github.com/SophieGarden/DataScience_NanoDegree/tree/master/Project1_finding_donors)



2. [Deep Learning: I built a flower species image classifier, achieved 90\% accuracy (vgg11, command line app) ](https://github.com/SophieGarden/DataScience_NanoDegree/tree/master/Project2_flower_species_image_classifier)

3. [Unsupervised Learning: I created a customer identifier for mail order company (PCA, K-Means) ](https://github.com/SophieGarden/DataScience_NanoDegree/tree/master/Project3_identify_groups)
